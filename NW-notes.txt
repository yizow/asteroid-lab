Overall, looks like a good start.

A few comments:

a)  You only need 1 RPi for prototyping, I will provide this in class.

b) The focus should be primarily on the network control: You should
for now just take a simple file that can have 3 different rule types
for an experiment:

    1:  Subnets, protocol, and port combinations allowed and denied

    2:  Bandwidth limits per unit time

These should be enforced.  For IP fragmentation, you should reassemble
fragments both inbound and outbound before passing traffic on to
ensure consistency and enforcement of the rules.

Bandwidth limits should use some form of leaky token bucket approach,
where you can burst temporarily above the limit but the sustained rate
is as specified.
